# Python Homework-Pybank and PyRamen
Observations from working the two assingments.

### Github
During the last couple of weeks, I have tried to routinely push code to the repository. I've learned that it's easier to submit code for assistance or review if I can submit a public link. I think the most interesting takeaway though from this assignment is in when to push code, and the importance of the commit message. Initially, I only pushed code when it was working. Several times, I included a commit "code working here." While the code may not have contained a syntax or type error (etc.), the code may not have worked the way I actually  needed to complete the assignment. So I omitted it in future notes. Additionally, I came to realize that it's ok to push code that has an error, if I'm clear about the point the code IS working. Again, it made it easier to seek feedback using a public link.

### Refined Code
I started working with a tutor two weeks ago while I was working through Pybank. I realized through the course of working with her, there were likely more concise ways to do accomplish what I did. EX: The counter I set could have been titled total_month_count, and it would have worked to count all months in the data set, versus having a counter variable AND a total_month variable. I opted to leave the code the way I wrote it originally, so later in the course I can go back and see for myself where I could make the code more concise/clean.

### Commenting Out
I feel like I'm getting much better at reading error codes, finding the line where the error is and diagnosing (with the help of Google of course.) However, I learned how to comment out large segments of code at the same time. This I found to be incredibly valuable in diagnosing syntax errors. I try to test variables and code along the way frequently, but sometimes you just can't see the misplaced parenthesis that caused the syntax error. I also realize errors can happen anytime, and what once was a piece of working code may no longer be. Being able to comment out code later in development can be useful to find errant mistakes along the way. 

### Pseudocode Helps
About halfway through Pybank I realized I needed some guide to follow. Pseudo coding what needed to happen next helped me move forward more quickly. So with Pyramen, I started with comments/pseudocode. While some of my success was the result of how the Pyramen prompt was written, it felt much easier to figure out what came next and was ultimately much easier to complete.
